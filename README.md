* GRoyne Impacts on Morphology *

GRIM is a simple PYQGIS plugin, providing a set of tools for analysing the impact of groynes on beach morphology and sediment transport.
It is designed to be user friendly, and offers a simple, streamlined UI that vastly reduces the time required to analyse the data, compared with doing it manually.

## Current Features
* Input the locations of groyne cells as either a single shapefile with multiple features, or multiple shapefiles. The validity of the files will be checked before any processing is carried out.
* The average beach elevation and beach volume within each groyne cell is calculated, along with its area.
* Results are output in a simple CSV format, which can be opened in programs such as Microsoft Excel.
